                <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
                <p>My name is Jalen Lewis. I am a 3rd year Computer Science student.
                   I was born in Fayetteville, NC, which is where I also graduated from high school.
                   However, I spent most of my adolescence here in Greensboro, NC.<br/><br/>
                   I love learning about new ways to care for the planet, doing community service projects, and I have found a new passion for kayaking. <br/><br/>
                   I chose Computer Science because I knew that I wanted to make a lasting, positive effect on people, and I figured software and developing applications would be the way to go.
                   Some of my areas of interest within Computer Science are accessibility within UI/UX and ethical considerations within technology.
