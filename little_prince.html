    As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
    <u>I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u></span>
    <span style="background-color:orange">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>

    <span style="color:red"><b>"What moves me
    so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
    that shines through his whole being like the flame
    of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</b></span>

    might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
